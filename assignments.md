# Assignments General Guidelines

Assignments are submitted on Moodle.  Assignments will be due on
Sunday night.

I will usually give you example code in p5.js - I encourage you to use
that to do your compositions. But you may do the assignment in any
programming language and with any library or set of tools.  The only
requirement is *programming* you can't just submit a digital art
composition you made in a tool like Adobe Illustrator.  If you wish,
you could take something generated programmatically and tweak it in a
graphical editor but the bulk must be generated from code of some
sort.

You must submit both the source code and an easily accessible way for
me to view the art (e.g. link to interactive online experience, a
image, youtube hosted video etc).  If you use p5.js this is as simple
as a link to your Sketch.  If you use something else, just be sure I
don't have to compile something on my local system to see your art.

# Assignment 1: Color

Visual art is all about color but I think as programmers we often
don't feel confident in our color choices.  But you can do a lot with
color:

All the textbook sketches in the first chapter have to do with color.
To try them out and get inspired, look for stuff beginning with P1_ here:

But consider this one in particular:

Note although there is some variation in color, we're not just picking
*random* colors from anywhere.  Lines 49-60 constrain the palette to
producing something the authors thought was pleasing.

What I'd like you to do is build a composition - could be a variation
of one of these existing sketches, could be something wholey new from
you.  The constraints are:
